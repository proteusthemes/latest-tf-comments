### Setup

When you clone the repo, you should install dependencies with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
$ composer install
```

The configuration is loaded using the [dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv). Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and enter your real credentials:

- `ENVATO_SECRET_TOKEN` - get it it on https://build.envato.com/my-apps/#tokens. It only needs default premission (*View and search Envato sites*).

### Requirements

PHP 5.5+ with curl.
